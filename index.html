<h1>KEY LESSON TAKEAWAYS</h1>

<h2>Web 101</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web was invented in the early 1990s and is essentially the world's largest network.
The World Wide Web at it's core is a collection of html documents that depends upon:<br>
*<em>YOU</em>*<br>
*<em>Your Web Browser*</em><br>
*<em>The Internet</em><br>
*<em>Servers*</em><br>
With all of these elements in place after you decide which webpage to visit, for example www.udacity.com, my 
web browser sends the request outside of my network and out into the internet using the http or https protocol
to eventually find the destination server, which will return the request back to my browser for me to enjoy. 
</p>

<h2>The Language of the Web</h2>

<b>HTML Overview</b>
<p>HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is foudnational to almost every web page on the internet. HTML consists of:<br><br>
*<b>Text Content</b> - the stuff you can see<br>
*<b>Markup</b> - how it appears<br>
*<b>References to other documents</b> - other types of media<br>
*<b>Links to other Pages</b> - Lots of links are strewn across pages like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program>Hello World</a>.
</p>

<b>HTML Markup</b><br>
<p>Things called tags are a set of instructions to make commands to the browser, which starts with an opening tag and closes with a closing
tag. Using specific tags, I can make a word <b>bold</b> or make a <em><b>bold emphasis</b></em>. These opening and 
closing tags are called elements.</p>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<p>We see HTML attributes all of the time when browsing the web, although invisible to the end-user. 
These attributes should look very familiar, as in  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute>HTML Attributes</a>
and <br> <img src="http://www.webdesign.org/img_articles/22307/551.jpg" width="140" height="80" alt="ImageText"></a>
</p>

<b>WhiteSpace</b>

<p>Outside of the tags and attributes, HTML may seem very similar to writing in a word processor.  One glaring difference
  is the use of whitespace, as text on multiple lines will still appear as if they are on the same line unless given
  specific instruction. Void tags like break can be used to force multiple lines or the paragraph tag can be used, which
  is wrapped inbetween content and is not a void tag.  A break tag is referred to as inline and a paragraph tag is 
  block. Another inline element is span and another block element is div, both service the function of controlling
  how text is laid out.

  <h2>Computers and People: sometimes not very bright</h2>
  <p>Computers are not intelligent, but thankfully people are and because of this relationship it is important to remember to 
  provide clear instructions when coding, as computers are not able to infer what "you meant to say."</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes humans aren't that bright either and our memories are not nearly as quick and accurate as the computers
  we create. Fortunately the HTML language is also used to write us instructions on how to remember what what has 
  been forgotten using <a href=-www.google.com>GOOGLE</a>!
